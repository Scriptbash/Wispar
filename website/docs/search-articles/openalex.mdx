# Search Articles With OpenAlex

The OpenAlex API allows searches similar to a search engine, making boolean queries possible.

:::tip Tip
OpenAlex supports the use of **parentheses** in queries.  
You can group keywords by wrapping them in parentheses across different keyword fields.  

Use the **query preview** to confirm that your search is structured correctly.
