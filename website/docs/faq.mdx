# FAQ

## Do I need an account to use Wispar?

No. Wispar does not require any kind of account. In fact, there is no account creation at all. Your data stays entirely in a local database on your device. An institutional account is only needed if you configure an institution in the EZproxy settings.

## My institution is not available in the list of proxies. How can it be added?

If your institution uses EZproxy, OpenAthens, or a similar proxy, it can be included by either submitting a pull request or opening an issue in the following GitHub repository: [ezproxy-db](https://github.com/tom5760/ezproxy-db)

Once the proxy is added to the repository, it will automatically become available in Wispar, since the proxy list is not cached.
